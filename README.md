Investment and Bond Calculator
This code provides a simple calculator to calculate either the amount of interest you'll earn on an investment or the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan.

Usage
Run the code.
You will be presented with a menu that asks you to enter either 'investment' or 'bond' to proceed.
Enter your choice, either 'investment' or 'bond', and press enter.
Investment Calculation
If you choose 'investment', the code will prompt you to enter the following details:

Principle amount (the initial investment)
Years of planned investment
Interest rate
Next, you need to specify whether you want to calculate 'simple' or 'compound' interest.

For simple interest, the code calculates and displays the total interest earned on your investment.
For compound interest, the code calculates and displays the total amount you will have after the specified years.
Bond Calculation
If you choose 'bond', the code will prompt you to enter the following details:

Current value for the house
Interest rate (annual percentage)
Number of months for repayment
The code will then calculate and display the amount to be paid monthly for the home loan.

Example
Enter either 'investment' or 'bond' from the menu above to proceed: investment
Enter the principle amount: 5000
Enter the years of planned investment: 5
Enter interest rate: 8
Enter either 'simple' or 'compound': simple

Your simple interest rate is: 5400.0
In the above example, an investment of $5000 with an interest rate of 8% over 5 years results in a simple interest rate of $5400.

Enter either 'investment' or 'bond' from the menu above to proceed: bond
Enter current value for the house: 250000
Enter the interest rate: 7
Enter the number of months for repayment: 120

Monthly repayment amount: 2684.11
In the above example, a house valued at $250,000 with an interest rate of 7% and a repayment period of 120 months results in a monthly repayment amount of $2684.11.
